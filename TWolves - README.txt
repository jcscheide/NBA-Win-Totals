Hi Cole! This is the package that I submitted to OKC. I've pasted the project brief below.
The code was written in Python, and the report document contains a more in depth description
of my thought process. Thanks!



Project Outline
Forecasting win-loss records
The purpose of this project is to create a model which predicts regular season win totals using data only
available before the season tips off. You may take advantage of any publicly available data for your
modeling. The project deliverable is a method which produces the lowest error in forecasting wins for a
season. You are free to use any techniques, programs, tools, or languages you like; however, your work
must be original.
After completing the project please answer each question. Please limit responses to 1-2 paragraphs.
1. Describe, generally, from start to finish how you approached, executed and completed the
project. Include relevant materials (ex: code) through a cloud storage provider (ex: Dropbox,
Google Drive).
2. Include and describe a visualization from the project. The visualization should highlight a feature
or insight from your predictive model. Explain the decisions you made in constructing the
visualization.
3. Imagine that a GM asks you to evaluate two trade proposals before the start of the 2018-19
season. The GM assures you that both deals provide positive value for the organization and any
outgoing assets will not have an effect on the upcoming season. Using takeaways from your
model, describe how you would advise the GM in selecting between the following two offers:
a. The more favorable unprotected 1st round pick from either the Los Angeles Clippers or
Detroit Pistons in the 2019 NBA draft
b. The unprotected 1st round pick from the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2019 NBA draft
